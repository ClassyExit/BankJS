# BankJS

A simple browser based bank application I developed while learning JavaScript (JS). 
In addition to JavaScript, I've incorporated a local-based database and a backend using node.js


RUNNING PROJECT:

Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) <br>
Navigate to the project folder and run the following from a terminal:
npm init -y (to create a Node.js project)
npm i express (to install Express)
node index.js (to run the server)
Open localhost in a web browser, using the port specified in index.js e.g. http://localhost:3000/
